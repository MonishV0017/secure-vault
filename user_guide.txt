### 4. Security and Data Management

**Change Password:**
  - Allows a logged-in user to change their main login password.
  - You must know your current password and provide a new "Strong" password to proceed.

**Backup Vault:**
  - Creates a single, secure backup file (`.sbu`) of your current vault.
  - WARNING: You will be asked for a Backup Password. This password encrypts the entire backup file. Do not lose this password.
  - It is highly recommended to store backup files on an external drive.

**Restore Vault:**
  - Restores your vault from a backup file.
  - WARNING: This is a destructive action. It will completely delete all files currently in your vault and replace them with the files from the backup.
  - You can ONLY restore backups that belong to your unique user account ID.

**View Activity Log:**
  - Shows a complete, time-stamped history of all actions on your account (logins, uploads, deletes, etc.). Use this to check for suspicious activity.

### 5. Account and Application Reset

**Delete Account:**
  - Permanently deletes your own account and all associated files.
  - WARNING: This action is irreversible. Your existing backups will become unusable because the user they belong to will be gone.
  - This requires your login password and a current MFA code for final confirmation.

**The Admin Role & Factory Reset:**
  - The **first user** to ever create an account in the application is designated as the "Admin".
  - Only this Admin can initiate a Factory Reset.
  - To perform a reset, click the "Factory Reset" button on the login screen. You must enter the Admin's email address and verify it with an OTP.
  - WARNING: The Factory Reset is the most destructive action. It completely WIPES the entire application for ALL users, deleting the database and all uploaded         files.
